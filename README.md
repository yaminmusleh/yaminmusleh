⚡ Full-Stack Developer
I build things for the web — thoughtfully, end‑to‑end, and with purpose.
I care about how things work, how they feel, and how they scale. My focus is writing clean code, making smart technical decisions, and shipping products that actually make sense to use.

What I’m About:
-Turning ideas into real, usable products
-Balancing solid engineering with clean UI/UX
-Writing code that’s easy to read, easy to change, and hard to break
-Solving problems instead of adding complexity

Stack & Skills:

Frontend:
-HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript (modern, not messy)
-Component-based frameworks
-Responsive layouts & accessibility

🧪 Projects:
The repositories here aren’t just demos — they reflect how I think and build:
Real-world structure
Clear separation of concerns
Intentional design decisions
No unnecessary fluff
Each project is documented so you can understand the why, not just the what.

🧩 Mindset:
Build it right, then make it fast
Clarity beats cleverness
If it’s hard to read, it’s not done

If you like how I build, want to collaborate, or just talk tech — you know where to find me.
